# Winter Prep 2025 (UIUC Economic + CS minor)

## Overview
Time: 12/21/2025 - 01/20/2026
Dialy 2 - 3 hours
Prepare for the spring semester courses and learn to build a small github project for my future study.
> Note: I'm trying a new study method this winter: learin in small steps and ship something every day, which can make my progress more visible and measurable.

AI tools may assist with explanations and feedback, but I treat them as suggestions.  
I only include material that I fully understand, and can reproduce independently.
