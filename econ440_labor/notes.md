# ECON 440 — Labor Markets Notes
Winter prep starts on 12/21. This folder tracks reading notes for ECON 440 (Economic of Labor Markets)

## Focus: Labor Supply + Labor Demand (warm-up)

### Motivation / Story
Labor economics studies how workers choose whether/how much to work and how firms decide how many workers to hire. Policies (taxes, benefits, minimum wage) change incentives and can shift these choices.

## Course map (my preview plan)
- Labor supply (individual choice)
- Labor demand (firms)
- Human capital (education, training)
- Wage structure & inequality
- Discrimination
- Unemployment, search, matching
- Institutions (unions, minimum wage)
- Immigration

## Glossary
- wage
- labor supply
- labor demand
- opportunity cost
- marginal product of labor (MPL)
- value of marginal product (VMP)
- human capital
- return to education
- extensive margin (work or not)
- intensive margin (how many hours)
- identification (causal inference)

## Labor Supply (individual choice)
### Key concepts
- labor–leisure tradeoff
- reservation wage
- substitution effect
- income effect
- extensive vs intensive margin

### Mechanism
A higher wage makes leisure more expensive (substitution effect → work more), but it also makes people richer (income effect → may work less). Therefore, the total effect of a wage increase on hours worked can be ambiguous.

### Mini example
If someone is struggling to pay rent, a higher wage may increase hours (substitution dominates). If someone already earns a lot, a higher wage might let them “buy” more leisure (income dominates).

##  Labor Demand (firms)
### Key concepts
- marginal product of labor (MPL)
- value of MPL / VMP
- diminishing returns
- labor demand elasticity

### Mechanism
Firms hire workers up to the point where the value of the worker’s marginal product equals the wage (VMP = wage). If wages rise, hiring becomes more expensive, so optimal employment tends to fall.

## Common pitfalls
1) Mixing up substitution vs income effects (labor supply).
2) Confusing MPL (marginal) with total/average product.

## 20-second summary
Labor supply comes from individual choice: wages create both substitution and income effects. Labor demand comes from firm optimization: firms hire until VMP equals the wage.

2) What does “VMP = wage” mean in hiring decisions?  
**Answer:** The firm hires workers until the extra value produced by the last worker equals the wage; beyond that point, hiring more would cost more than it returns.
