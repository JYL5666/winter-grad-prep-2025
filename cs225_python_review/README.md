# CS225 Python Review Project
This is a small project to review core data structures in Python (learned previously in SWUFE, now rebuilding cleanly).

## what I will implement
- Linked List
- Stack / Queue
- Binary Search Tree (BST)
- Hash Table

## Rules
- Every structure has: implementation + minimal tests + complexity notes.
- Each file should be runnable via `python filename.py` (use `if __name__ == "__main__":`).
