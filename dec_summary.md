# December Summary（12/2025）

## What I did
- Built and initialized the repo structure
- Started course warm-ups and produced small artifacts
- Reviewed and conducted assert tests on the Python code for data structures

## What I will focus on next month
- Keep the “small runnable artifact per day” habit (C++ + Python + notes).
- Make cs225 files consistently runnable and add simple tests / main entrypoints.
- Improve the repository navigation: clearer README map and predictable file naming.
