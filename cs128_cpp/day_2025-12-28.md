# Day 2005-12-28 （cs128 if/else）

## Goal
- Build a small C++ program using if/else
- Run with normal input + edge input
- Paste outputs into notes.md
- Commit & push

## Log
- start time: 17:17
- end time: 18:24
- What I finished: 
    - learned definitions and operations of control flow
    - control.cpp + 2 runs
    - writen notes about C++ control flow (if/else)
- Problems I met:
    - I often forget `;` at the end of a statement (compiler error like: expected ';').
    - I was confused by `if (!cin)` and why input can "fail".
